# Deep Copy Utility

## Description

The Deep Copy Utility provides functionality for deep copying various Java collections and custom objects. This project includes methods for copying `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and custom objects like `User` and `Book`. The utility ensures that the copied objects are distinct instances from the original, making it suitable for scenarios where object integrity is critical.

## Features

- Deep copy for `List`, `Set`, and `Map` collections.
- Deep copy for custom objects.
- Immutable objects like `String` are handled correctly.
- Unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure reliability.
- Utilizes features from Java 21 for improved syntax and performance.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 21 or higher.
- **Maven** or **Gradle** for dependency management.
- An **IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for running the project and tests.
